            * Ranks start at F now instead of E<br>
            * Fixed wild mana tooltip<br>
            * Added Tournament, which uses self combat.

            <version verNum=".75"><![CDATA[
            * Skill training actions have 150% exp.<br>
            * Practical magic updates the gold cost tooltip correctly<br>
            * Ping on Pause toggle saves on refresh<br>
            * Started French support (thanks to Guizmus)<br>
            * Haggle tooltip updates on reset correctly. Continue On mana reduction tooltip works.<br>
            * Can't use repeat last action to get around training caps<br>
            * New actions - Adventure Guild, Crafting Guild, Gather Team, Craft Armor, Large Dungeon, Apprentice, Mason, Architect<br>
            * Short Quest mana cost 800 -> 600. LQuest mana cost 2k -> 1500, gold reward 25 -> 30<br>
            * Buy Supplies requires 400 -> 300 gold.<br>
            * Wild Mana 200 gain -> 250 gain.<br>
            * Removing old versions as I add new ones now<br>
            * Removed Get Drunk's gold cost, gave it 3x exp<br>
            * Reworked dungeons - small dungeon is now capped at 6 floors, with soulstone chances and completed bonuses applying per-floor. Your existing completions were divided amongst the new floors.<br>
            * Small Dungeon mana cost to 2k (until I get an option to short-circuit upon floor completion) and gets harder faster.<br>
            * Made talent gain scale the same way that soulstone does, made soulstones 1/3rd as effective. This means talent gives 3% at level 1 instead of 1%.<br>
            * HtS requires (not costs) 1 reputation, Fight Monster and Small Dungeon require 2 reputation.<br>
            * Training caps reduced to 10 (action coming soon to improve this), and all trainings have 2000 mana cost.<br>
            * Train Dex/Train Speed to zone 2.<br>
            * Soulstones recover half as fast (because there's more of them)

                <a>Hover over "Stats" for how they work. What stats are important depend on what actions you need that
                    uses them.

                <q>Short runs seem better.</q>
                <a>Short runs are better, for the early game and current balance. As your runs get longer and you accrue
                    talent and soulstones they become more useful.

                <q>What should my first goal be?</q>
                <a>Start with wandering until you have ways of getting mana back. Then try to find how to get some
                    combat training which gives you a permanent boost, and then try fighting monsters!

                You're a simple courier, on a long trip to deliver a high priority package. Just as you entered town,
                you tripped - breaking your glasses - and the package burst open, spilling a strange liquid on you.
                Immediately, your meager amount of mana started draining rapidly. Right as your mana became empty, you
                found yourself back in the moment the liquid was absorbed into your skin, with your tiny reserves
                filled... yet draining just as before. This happened again and again, the world resetting with you,
                until you decided you had to figure out a way to prolong how long these 'loops' were. Mana crystals are
                often stored in pottery around town, perhaps you'll start there ...
            </story>
            <story num="1">
                You reach the end of the dungeon, where a softly glowing orb floats on a pedastal. You've found the
                dungeon core - for the first level of the dungeon, at least. As you grasp it, the essence dives into
                you, infusing your very being with the power it holds. It is a small amount of power, but this is a
                small dungeon. You'll be back to take this power again, knowing with the foreign knowledge implanted
                that it will stay with you no matter when you are.
            </story>
            <story num="2">
                You reach the end of the dungeon again, but for the first time the core isn't glowing. It's always been
                thought that dungeon cores build based on the mana spent around them, but you're beginning to think the
                essence of it's previous incarnations drains it somehow. It doesn't always happen, but you'll need to
                put more mana into the world to take the core's benefits out of it. You shrug, accepting yet another
                oddity of the loops.
            </story>
            <story num="3">
                You've done it! You've won the tournament and obtained the cure. You can stop looping at any moment.

          Each stat level reduces the relevant part of an action's mana cost by 1%.<br>
          Talent gets 1% of all level progress, and persists through loops.<br>
          Talent multipliers xp by (1+(talentLevel)^.5/5).<br>
          XP gain towards a stat per action is (original mana / actual mana) * (talent bonus) per tick.<br>
          Total Mult is a combination of talent and soulstone bonuses.<br><br>
          e.g. Meet People costs 800 mana and has a breakdown of <div class="bold">Int</div> 10% <div class="bold">Cha</div> 80% <div class="bold">Soul</div> 10%.<br>
          This effectively means 80 of the mana is controlled by <div class="bold">Int</div>, another 80 by <div class="bold">Soul</div>, and the remaining 640 by <div class="bold">Cha</div>.<br>
          If your <div class="bold">Cha</div> is level 20 when the action is started, the bonus would be x1.2 it'd be 640 / 1.2 = 533.33<br>
          Adding back the 160 from <div class="bold">Soul</div> and <div class="bold">Int</div>, the total mana the action takes (rounded up) is now 694, so ~87% of the original mana cost.<br>
          The action would give (800/694)*(1+(talentLevel)^.5/5) level exp per mana for the 694 mana.]]></explanation>
